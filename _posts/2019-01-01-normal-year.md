2020 cannot be another normal year.

Thousands of people huddling in the ocean on the edge of the continent as their town becomes smoke...

Unpaid firefighters dying in their trucks...

A bleaching reef...

Animals fleeing from flames into the path of bulldozers...

Towns running out of drinking water...

…all while corporations dig up our future, sell it to the highest bidder and laugh their way to the bank, backed by every level of government on this continent.

Something is very wrong here.

Voting, letter-writing, petitions, social media, showing up at a few police-approved protests—you tried all that, and it didn’t work.

Because they can ignore it.

Just like they ignore the rivers drying up, the animals dying of heatstroke by their thousands, and the way it just doesn't rain like it used to.

Time for the good news: they cannot ignore an escalating campaign of nonviolent direct action against business as usual.

They cannot ignore a disrupted parliament, blocked coal trains, protestors locked on at coal mines, glue-ons at the offices of dirty corporations, blocked bridges, and people filling our streets and refusing to move.

This has worked before and it will work again.

What can you do?

Rebel!

Come to our weekly meetings. Join a working group, plan mass mobilisations, make food for action days, get media-trained, tell the truth, become a legal observer, create protest art—chuck a sickie and come to our actions! Let’s get to work.

It’s 2020, the clock’s ticking, and you need to make a few choices: do you want to stand by or take a stand? Talk or act? Extinction or rebellion?

Don’t let this year be another normal year.

Don’t let today be another normal day.

Because there are no normal days anymore.
