Warriors of the Aboriginal Resistance - WAR: 

> “Invasion Day 2020 marks 250 years of colonial destruction of First Nations people and our lands and waters. The past 250 years of colonial destruction has created the many issues that we are currently facing. Invasion Day is an event where First Nations people mourn, survive and continue to resist against the colonial terrorism organisation that is Australia and defend sovereignty.”


Get it right: First Nations people have been fighting for justice for 250 years now—that’s about 250 times longer than we have.

We need climate justice, not just climate action by an unjust government. This means we must stand in solidarity with the groups who are marginalised by the climate crisis and the capitalist and colonialist systems that have caused it.

Since invasion, we've been ignoring First Nations knowledge on how to care for and live in balance with the ecosystems on this continent, and we’re all paying the price now. The system is rigged—time to start listening, valuing and enacting this old knowledge of how to care for country and build sustainable communities.

On Sunday the 26th of January, a week from today, we’ll be marching with all First Nations peoples on the stolen land of the Jagera, Turrbal, Yuggera and Yugarabul peoples.

But don’t just stand in solidarity on this one day—keep fighting, keep listening. Show up to protect sacred land, like at Deebing Creek Mission, just near Ipswich, where there’s sacred land and mass burial sites being invaded by property developers right now.

White Australia: it’s time to start paying the rent—with your actions, your words and your wallets.

Not as rebels, but as people.

So should you.
