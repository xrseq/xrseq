## reclaiming the future

We are working towards mobilising enough of the population to achieve system change.

We are creating a world that is fit for generations to come. 

Please, join us in the fight for life.

## Extinction Rebellion has 10 Principles

1. We have a shared vision of change
2. We set our mission on what is necessary
3. We need a regenerative culture
4. We openly challenge ourselves and this toxic system
5. We value reflecting and learning
6. We welcome everyone and every part of everyone
7. We actively mitigate for power
8. We avoid blaming and shaming
9. We are a non-violent network
10. We are based on autonomy and decentralisation

##  We demand of our entire system

1. CLIMATE ACTION: Zero emissions, drawdown and 100% renewable by 2025.
2. PRESERVE BIODIVERSITY: End land clearing and give nature legal rights.
3. TELL THE TRUTH: Spread the science on climate change and report all facts honestly.
4. Dismantle Colonial Systems of Exploitation: Decolonise and replace oppressive government structures with systems of self-management and true participatory democracy.

## REBEL

We are willing to make personal sacrifices. We are prepared to be arrested and to go to prison. We will lead by example and always act peacefully.

We will not be led quietly to annihilation by the elites and politicians. We will act honorably, resiliently, and peacefully, in the spirit of all those who fought for our freedoms before us. We call on everyone, regardless of your political beliefs to join us in fighting for the survival of our nation and for the survival of life on earth.

## VISION

A world where we build thriving connections within our society and environment, bringing hope and enabling us to decide the direction of our lives and futures. An inclusive world, where we work consciously to ensure fair processes of collective decision-making, where creativity is prioritised, and where our diversity of gifts are recognised, celebrated and flourish.
